With a simple web search we found out that Astoria is the Greek cultured neighborhood of New York city since it was the home of the first Greek immigrants. So the most suitable neighborhoods to open a Greek restaurant in Queens and we could say in all of New York city are by far neighborhoods close to __Astoria__, and also __Bayside__, __Bay Terrace__ and __Douglaston__."
